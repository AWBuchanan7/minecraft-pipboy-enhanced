Pipboy Enhanced 
============

This is a fork of the popular 1.7.10 mod 'InfiniteInvo' inspired by the Fallout games. Pipboy Enhanced originated as an amalgamation of InfiniteInvo, InventoryCrafting, and assets from the original Fallout texture pack for Minecraft.

Currently the 1.7.10 branch is fully functional, and a 1.12.2 branch is to come!

Features:

- Fallout themed inventory graphics
- Enlarged, scrollable inventory space 
- Built-in 3x3 crafting grid in inventory
